  - The hypervisor is deployed on top of a general-purpose operating system (OS), creating a layered virtualization setup.

- **2. Examples:**
  - Examples of Type 2 hypervisors include VirtualBox.

**Advantages:**

- **1. Ease of Deployment:**
  - Type 2 hypervisors are easier to deploy since they run on top of a general-purpose OS without the need for direct hardware interaction.

**Disadvantages:**

- **1. Performance Limitations:**
  - Performance is typically lower compared to Type 1 hypervisors because the hypervisor operates within the context of a general-purpose OS, which is not optimized for virtualization purposes.

**Hybrid Solutions:**

- **1. KVM and Xen:**
  - KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) and Xen represent hybrid solutions. While they are Type 2 hypervisors, their hypervisors require installing specific kernel modules on top of general-purpose OSs, introducing elements of Type 1 functionality.

**Considerations:**

- Type 2 hypervisors are suitable for scenarios where ease of deployment is a priority, and performance considerations are secondary. Hybrid solutions like KVM and Xen offer a compromise by introducing certain optimizations while still running on top of a general-purpose OS.
