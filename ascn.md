## Agile Development

- **Formal (Versioned) Repositories:**
  - Agile development relies on formal, versioned repositories for source code, binaries, and documentation.
  - This ensures an unambiguous current state of the project and provides the ability to backtrack to previous versions if needed.

- **Automated Build and Test:**
  - Agile development emphasizes the use of automated build and test processes.
  - This automation provides fast feedback on the quality of the code, helping to identify and address issues early in the development cycle.

- **Fast Iterations:**
  - Agile promotes fast iterations, allowing development teams to deliver incremental improvements and updates quickly.
  - This iterative approach facilitates a continuous feedback loop and ensures that the project evolves in response to changing requirements.

- **Quick Reaction to Frequent Small Changes:**
  - Agile methodologies enable teams to react quickly to frequent and often small changes in requirements.
  - This adaptability is crucial in dynamic environments where priorities and specifications may evolve during the course of the project.

In summary, Agile development is characterized by its reliance on versioned repositories, automated processes for building and testing, fast iterations, and the ability to react swiftly to frequent, small changes in project requirements.

### Operations

- **Manual Provisioning and Configuration:**
  - In traditional operations, manual provisioning and configuration of infrastructure and systems are common practices.
  - This manual approach can be time-consuming, error-prone, and lacks the scalability needed for modern systems.

- **Informal Communication between Qualification and Production Stages:**
  - There may be informal communication practices between the qualification (development, testing) and production stages in traditional operations.
  - This lack of formalized communication can lead to misunderstandings and discrepancies between different stages of the software development lifecycle.

- **Consequences:**
  - *Not Repeatable or Reproducible:*
    - Manual processes often result in configurations that are not easily repeatable or reproducible, making it challenging to ensure consistency across different environments.

  - *Configuration Drift:*
    - Lack of automation can lead to configuration drift, where the actual configuration of systems diverges over time from their intended state.

  - *“Snowflake” Servers:*
    - Manual configurations can result in unique, one-of-a-kind servers, often referred to as "snowflake" servers. These are difficult to manage and maintain.

  - *Subjective Monitoring:*
    - Without standardized and automated monitoring, the monitoring practices can be subjective and may not provide a comprehensive view of system health and performance.

In summary, traditional operations characterized by manual provisioning, informal communication, and lack of automation can lead to issues such as non-reproducibility, configuration drift, the emergence of "snowflake" servers, and subjective monitoring practices.


### Infrastructure as Code

- **Hardware Provisioning with Scripts:**
  - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) involves using scripts to automate the provisioning of hardware.
  - This is a departure from traditional methods where physical hardware is manually unboxed and plugged in. Automation allows for efficient and repeatable infrastructure setup.

- **Software Provisioning with Scripts:**
  - IaC extends to software provisioning, where scripts are used to automate the installation and configuration of software components.
  - This contrasts with the manual process of clicking through setup wizards, providing a more reliable and scalable approach.

- **Configuration with Scripts:**
  - IaC also encompasses configuration management, enabling the automation of system configurations through scripts.
  - This stands in contrast to the traditional method of manually clicking through control panels to configure settings, ensuring consistency and reproducibility.

- **Include Infrastructure Scripts in Agile Process:**
  - In the Agile development process, it's essential to include infrastructure scripts as part of the overall development and deployment pipeline.
  - This integration ensures that changes to infrastructure are treated as code, promoting collaboration between development and operations teams and allowing for continuous integration and delivery.

In summary, Infrastructure as Code involves automating hardware provisioning, software installation, and configuration using scripts. This approach contrasts with manual methods and aligns with Agile processes by treating infrastructure changes as code.

# Agile + Infrastructure as Code -> DevOps

**Agile Development:**
- Agile development is a set of principles and practices that emphasize iterative development, collaboration, and the ability to quickly respond to changes in project requirements.

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**
- Infrastructure as Code involves managing and provisioning infrastructure through machine-readable script files, promoting automation, consistency, and scalability.

**DevOps:**
- DevOps is a cultural and organizational approach that combines development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams to improve collaboration, communication, and efficiency throughout the software development lifecycle.

**Key Points:**
- Agile development and Infrastructure as Code are complementary practices that contribute to the DevOps philosophy.
- Agile's focus on rapid iterations aligns with DevOps principles of continuous integration and delivery.
- IaC supports DevOps by automating infrastructure management, ensuring consistency across environments, and facilitating faster and more reliable deployments.

In essence, the combination of Agile development and Infrastructure as Code forms the foundation for a DevOps culture, fostering collaboration between development and operations teams to deliver high-quality software more efficiently.


# DevOps

- **Development and Deployment are Self-Documenting and Versioned:**
  - In DevOps, both development and deployment processes are self-documenting, meaning the steps and configurations are captured in code and documentation.
  - Version control systems are used to track changes, providing a historical record and enabling teams to roll back to previous states if necessary.

- **Deployment is Reproducible and Repeatable:**
  - DevOps emphasizes the importance of reproducibility and repeatability in deployment processes.
  - Automated deployment scripts and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) ensure that deployments are consistent across different environments and can be easily replicated.

- **Servers are Disposable and Consistent:**
  - DevOps encourages treating servers as disposable entities, meaning they can be easily replaced or recreated.
  - This approach minimizes the impact of server failures and ensures consistency by using automated provisioning and configuration management.

- **Supports Fast, Frequent, Small Changes:**
  - DevOps is designed to support a development approach that involves making fast, frequent, and small changes to the software.
  - Continuous integration, continuous delivery, and automation enable teams to release updates quickly, respond to changing requirements, and deliver value to users in a timely manner.

In summary, DevOps promotes self-documenting and versioned development and deployment, reproducible and repeatable deployments, disposable and consistent servers, and supports the implementation of fast, frequent, and small changes in software development processes.


### Distributed Systems Architectures & Deployment

- **Common Distribution Patterns:**
  - Distributed systems often employ common distribution patterns such as microservices, service-oriented architecture (SOA), and event-driven architecture.
  - These patterns enable the development of scalable and loosely coupled systems.

- **Reliability and Scalability:**
  - Distributed systems focus on ensuring reliability and scalability to handle a large number of users and data.
  - Techniques like redundancy, load balancing, and fault tolerance are employed to enhance system robustness.

- **Automatic Provision and Configuration:**
  - Automatic provisioning and configuration management are essential in distributed systems.
  - Tools like Kubernetes, Docker, and configuration management systems automate the deployment and scaling of services.
